# ALU Implementation on a FPGA
## Overview 
<p>The ULA-VHDL repository contains the VHDL source code for the implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on an FPGA board.  </p>
## Features
<p> <ul> The ALU is capable of performing 3 arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction and multiplication) and 5 logic operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR and NOT) between two 4-bit vectors.</ul>
<ul> Hardware testing using LEDs, switches and push buttons on the board.</ul></p>
