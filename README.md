# ALU Implementation on a FPGA
## Project Goals
<p> Developing and implementing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on the Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA board. The project takes part on the conclusion of the Digital Systems-EEL480 course provided by the Eletronics and Computing Engeneering major at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
  
## Overview 
<p>The ULA-VHDL repository contains the VHDL source code for the implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on an FPGA board. </p>

## Features
<p> <li> The ALU is capable of performing 3 arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction and multiplication) and 5 logic operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR and NOT) between two 4-bit vectors.</li>
<li> Hardware testing using LEDs, switches and push buttons on the board.</li></p>
